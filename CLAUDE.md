# Moonshots - Instructions

Repo for app and product ideas. Pipeline: idea → proposal → product → build.

**Language:** Always write in English, regardless of input language.

## Structure

```
topics/      # Raw ideas, interesting topics
proposals/   # Elaborated proposals  
products/    # Product docs ready to build
archive/     # Paused or discarded ideas
```

## Status

Each idea has a status in the title:
- 🌱 **Idea** - just noted
- 🔍 **Exploring** - researching
- 📝 **Proposal** - has written proposal
- 📋 **Product** - has complete product doc
- 🚀 **Building** - has its own repo (link in doc)
- ❄️ **Paused** - on ice for now
- ❌ **Discarded** - not happening

## Workflow

1. **New idea** → create file in `topics/` using template
2. **Explore** → research, jot down thoughts
3. **Proposal** → if promising, move to `proposals/` and elaborate
4. **Product** → if it clicks, move to `products/` and write full product doc
5. **Build** → create dedicated repo, link from product doc, mark 🚀

## Conventions

- File names: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `ai-fitness-coach.md`)
- One file per idea
- Language: **English only**
- No strict rules, this is a space to think
