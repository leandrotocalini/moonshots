# Kids Visual Coding

## Overview

Visual programming/coding puzzles for young children. No text, no typing - just drag & drop logic blocks to solve puzzles.

## Target

- **Age:** 5-8 years old
- **Platform:** iPad (touch-first)
- **Category:** Kids / Education / Puzzle / Coding

## Why This Space?

- "Learn to code" is HOT with parents
- Schools pushing computational thinking
- Teaches real skills (sequencing, loops, conditionals)
- Less competition than generic puzzle games
- Premium pricing accepted ($4.99-$9.99)
- Great for App Store featuring (Apple loves education)

## Core Concept

Kid programs a character to reach a goal using visual blocks. No reading required - everything is icons/symbols.

### Basic Mechanics (Age 5-6)
- **Move blocks:** ⬆️ ⬇️ ⬅️ ➡️
- **Sequence:** drag blocks in order, press play
- **Goal:** get character to the star/treasure

### Intermediate (Age 6-7)
- **Loops:** repeat block (do this 3 times)
- **Actions:** pick up, put down, jump
- **Obstacles:** avoid enemies, push boxes

### Advanced (Age 7-8)
- **Conditionals:** if wall → turn (icon-based, no text)
- **Simple functions:** save a sequence, reuse it
- **Debugging:** find the bug in existing code

## Existing Competition

| App | Pros | Cons |
|-----|------|------|
| Lightbot | Great puzzles | Dated UI, some reading |
| ScratchJr | Very powerful | Complex, overwhelming |
| Kodable | Good curriculum | Subscription model 😤 |
| Tynker | Comprehensive | Too complex, subscription |
| Code.org apps | Free | Requires reading, web-based |

## Our Differentiators

1. **Zero reading required** - 100% visual, icons only
2. **Beautiful modern UI** - not "educational app" ugly
3. **Gradual complexity** - starts SUPER simple
4. **One-time purchase** - no subscriptions
5. **Offline-first** - works on airplane, no account needed
6. **Delightful animations** - character reacts, celebrates

## Character/Theme Ideas

### Option A: Robot
- Classic coding theme
- Robot follows instructions literally
- Factory/space setting

### Option B: Animal/Creature
- Friendlier, less "techy"
- Help bunny find carrots
- Garden/forest setting

### Option C: Abstract
- Geometric shapes
- Minimalist Monument Valley style
- No character, just the code

## Monetization

- **Option A:** $4.99 full game
- **Option B:** Free World 1, $3.99 unlock all
- **NO ads ever**
- **NO subscriptions**

## Technical Notes

- SpriteKit or SwiftUI + Canvas
- Level editor for rapid content creation
- JSON-based level format
- Analytics-free (privacy)

## Validation Questions

1. Can 5-year-olds understand loops visually?
2. What icons work universally? (no text)
3. How many levels needed for $4.99 value?
4. Daily challenges for retention?
5. Parent dashboard? (see kid's progress)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Paper prototype 5 levels
- [ ] Test with actual kids (borrow some 😅)
- [ ] Define character/theme
- [ ] Sketch UI
- [ ] Move to proposals/ when validated
