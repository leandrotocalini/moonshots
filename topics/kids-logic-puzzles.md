## Overview

Logic and puzzle game for young children on iPad.

## Target

## Why This Space?

- Parents love "educational" games (less guilt)
- Less crowded than art/drawing apps
- Clear progression = kids stay engaged
- Easy to make "one more level" addictive (in a good way)
- Schools sometimes recommend logic games

## Puzzle Types to Explore

### Pattern Recognition
- Complete the sequence (shapes, colors, numbers)
- Find the odd one out
- Mirror patterns

### Spatial Reasoning
- Tangrams (fit shapes into outline)
- Rotate and fit
- Build with blocks (isometric view)

### Logic Grids
- Simple "who lives where" puzzles
- Process of elimination (age-appropriate)

### Mazes & Pathfinding
- Classic mazes
- "Get the character home"
- Avoid obstacles

### Cause & Effect
- Rube Goldberg-style machines
- "What happens next?"
- Chain reactions

### Coding-Adjacent (No Text)
- Sequence of moves to reach goal
- Like Lightbot but simpler
- Visual programming blocks

## Existing Competition

- **Monument Valley** - beautiful but older kids/adults
- **Cut the Rope** - physics puzzles
- **Thinkrolls** - good, but dated UI
- **Lightbot** - coding puzzles
- **Busy Shapes** - for younger kids (2-5)
- **DragonBox** - math-focused

## Potential Differentiators

1. **No text required** - 100% visual, works in any language
2. **Adaptive difficulty** - adjusts to kid's skill automatically
3. **Zero frustration design** - hints that don't feel like cheating

## Questions to Answer

1. What's the "hook"? Theme? Characters?
2. Story/narrative or pure puzzles?
3. How many puzzle types to include?
4. Progression system (stars? unlockables?)
5. Daily challenges for retention?
