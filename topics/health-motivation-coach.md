# 🌱 Health Motivation Coach

## What?
An app that connects to Apple Health and only motivates you. Reads your weight, height, and exercise data. When it sees you're losing weight, it cheers you on. Minimal inputs — just reads from HealthKit.

## Why does it interest me?
- Most fitness apps are complex and require tons of input
- People need motivation, not another tracker
- Apple Health already has all the data — why enter it twice?
- Simple concept: read data → send encouragement

## Notes
- **Core insight:** The app does ONE thing — motivate. No logging, no meal plans, no workout suggestions. Just "hey, you're doing great!"
- **HealthKit data needed:**
  - Weight (historical to see trend)
  - Height (for context/BMI if needed)
  - Workouts/exercise minutes
  - Steps (maybe)
- **Motivation triggers:**
  - Weight going down → celebrate
  - Consistent workouts → acknowledge streak
  - Hit a plateau → encourage patience
  - Weight going up → gentle, non-judgmental nudge
- **Tone:** Supportive friend, not drill sergeant
- **Possible features:**
  - Daily/weekly motivation notification
  - Progress visualization (simple, not overwhelming)
  - Milestones celebration (every kg lost, etc.)
- **Monetization?** Premium for advanced insights? Or keep it free and simple?

## Questions
- How to handle weight fluctuations (water weight, etc.) without false positives?
- What's the right notification frequency?
- How to be motivating without being annoying?
